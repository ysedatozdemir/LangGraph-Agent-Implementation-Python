# LangGraph Greeting Agent (Python)

A minimal LangGraph implementation showcasing the framework's core concepts without LLM dependencies. This project demonstrates how to build a simple single-node agent using StateGraph, proper state management, and START → node → END flow.

## 🎯 Purpose

This is a learning project that focuses on:
- Understanding LangGraph's basic architecture
- Working with StateGraph and state schemas
- Implementing nodes without LLM complexity
- Following best practices for Python package management with `uv`

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Single-node agent with clear state schema
- ✅ No LLM dependencies - pure Python logic
- ✅ Proper START → greeting_node → END structure
- ✅ Managed with `uv` for modern Python packaging
- ✅ Well-documented development process

## 🚀 What It Does

Accepts a user's name as input and returns a personalized greeting message.

**Input:** `{"name": "Sedat"}`  
**Output:** `{"greeting": "Hello, Sedat! Welcome!"}`
